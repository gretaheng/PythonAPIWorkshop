# PythonAPIWorkshop

# Using APIs to Collect Data from Media/Social Media Sources
This workshop assumes attendees are familiar with the basics of Python and Jupyter Notebook but all are encouraged to attend. We will learn about APIs (Application Program Interface) and use the New York Times Article Search API as an example to collect data returned from the API with Python. Then we will parse the messy data output into something meaningful. The slides and Jupyter Notebook used in this workshop can be found here.
